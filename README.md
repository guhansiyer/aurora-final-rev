# Aurora

Aurora is a Processing program that allows users to reserve airline tickets for travel, either individually or for a group. The application generates three different planes with varying amounts of seats depending on the travel class the user selects in the GUI. Through a text field, users can select which seats they would like to reserve, and once reserved, a ticket for the aforementioned seat will be generated and displayed in a new window.
